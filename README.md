Methodology:

  A. Exploratory Data Analysis: 01. Data Exploration.ipynb
  
      Findings:
      1: Frauds are evenly distributed across weeks (Given that each Step as a hour, there is data of 31 days split into 4 sections of 186 hours. Each section is termed as a week)
      2: No missing value in the data
      3: Not many customers repeating transactions in two consequetive weeks. Me vs Me features will be sparse
      4: Negligible fraud among repeat transacting customers
      5: Only CASH_OUT and TRANSFER type of transactions are flagged Fraud
      6: isFlaggedFraud is only 1 when isFraud is 1
      7: All transactions above the minimum amount when isFlaggedFraud==1 is not Fraud
      8: isFlaggedFraud definition is not consistent with the definition provided in the variable description
      9: For all isFlaggedFraud==1, oldBalanceDest=newBalanceDest=0 and transaction type is only TRANSFER. No consistent patterm in other variables when isFlaggedFraud==1
      10: There are other TRANSFERS where isFlaggedFraud==0 and oldBalanceDest=newBalanceDest=0
      11: No particular threshold for amt_bal_ratio (Amount/Old Balance Orig) when isFlaggedFraud==1. Range overlaps when isFlaggedFraud==0
      12: Merchants are only in Destination Name
      13: Only PAYMENT is done towards Merchants and subsequently no Fraud
      14: Only Customer in Transaction Origin and Customer and Merchant in Transaction Destination. All Frauds is happening in Transactions between Customers
      15: New Balance Orig is not equal to zero when Amount > Old Balance Origin due to CASH IN
      16: New Balance Orig is not equal to zero and Amount > Old Balance Origin and type==CASH OUT data does not tally with Balance movements. There is not corresponding CASH IN or Name in Destination for the corresponding Names
      17: For CASH IN Transactions majority cases NEW Balance Origin - OLD Balance Origin == Amount. For the cases its doesnt hold true, NEW Balance Origin == OLD Balance Origin
      18: New Balance Origination==0 is not a distinguisher between Fraud and Non Fraud transactions
      19: All transactions with Amount==0 are Fraud
      20: Distinct difference in pattern of ZERO Origination and Destination Balance for Fraud and Non Fraud Transactions
      21: Old Balance Orig tend to be higher for Fraud than Non Fraud transactions. Customer with higher balances are usually targeted for Fraud
      
      Actions based on the above findings:
      1: Take first Week 2 and 3 as Train and Week 4 as OOT Validation sample [Findings: 1]
      2: No missing value imputation required [Findings: 2]
      3: Features created from single transactions and me vs others.[Findings: 3,4]
      4: Model data on only CASH_OUT and TRANSFER transactions/Create variable with extra weightage to CASH_OUT and TRANSFER transaction types [Findings: 5]
      5: isFlaggedFraud feature can be dropped [6 - 11]
      6: Create a flag for Payments to Merchants if modelling data on all transaction types[12 - 14]
      7: Assign a standard value for Amount/oldBalanceOrig for CASH IN type transactions while developing model on all types of transaction [15-17]
      8: Assign Flag for Amount==0 [19]
      9: Create categories of Old Balance Orig for CASH_OUT & TRANSFER type transactions [21]
      
  B. Feature Engineering for CASH_OUT & TRANSFER type transactions
  
  1:  02.A. Data Exploration and Feature Engineering - Cash Out & Transfer.ipynb
  
      Feature: $ amount of tranaction and number of transaction done by a customer in last 186 hours
      Since the data had lot ~2.8 million rows it was taking sufficient amount of time to create the feature, so it was not added in model development
          
  2:  02.B. Data Exploration and Feature Engineering - Cash Out & Transfer.ipynb
  
      Feature:
      $TransLW : $ amount of transaction done in last week, i.e if a customer is transacting in week 2 it will capture the $ amount of transaction done in week 1
      NumTransLW: Number of transaction done in last week, i.e if a customer is transacting in week 2 it will capture the number of transaction done in week 1
      FraudBefore: Flag 1 if the Destination Name was in a Fraud transaction before
      oldBalanceOrigCat: Divide Old Balance Orig in 3 bands
      amount_median: Median $ amount of a particular oldBalanceOrigCat
      amount_std: SD $ amount of a particular oldBalanceOrigCat
      amt_max: Max $ amount of a particular oldBalanceOrigCat
      amount_deviance_1: (amount - amount_median)/amount_std
      amount_deviance_2: amount - amount_median
      amount_deviance_3: amt_max - amount
      amount_deviance_4: (amt_max - amount)/amt_max
      amt_bal_perc: amount/oldBalanceOrig
      time_of_day: Dividing every 24 steps into 3 categories
      amount_tod_median: Median $ amount of a particular oldBalanceOrigCat and time_of_day
      amount_tod_std: SD $ amount of a particular oldBalanceOrigCat and time_of_day
      amount_tod_max: Max $ amount of a particular oldBalanceOrigCat and time_of_day
      amount_deviance_5: (amount - amount_tod_median)/amount_tod_std
      amount_deviance_6: amount - amount_tod_median
      amount_deviance_7: amount_tod_max - amount
      amount_deviance_8: (amount_tod_max - amount)/amount_tod_max
      diffBalanceOrig: newBalanceOrig + amount - oldBalanceOrig
      diffBalanceDest: oldBalanceDest + amount - newBalanceDest
         
  C. Model Development
  
  1. 03.A.1 Model Development - Fraud During Transaction.ipynb
  
    Model developed considering detecting fraudulent transaction during occurance of transaction.
    Removing following features during model development:
    1. nameOrig
    2. newBalanceOrig
    3. nameDest
    4. newBalanceDest
    5. isFlaggedFraud
    6. diffBalanceOrig
    7. diffBalanceDest
    
    Dependent Varaible: isFraud
    Model Development Period: Week 2 and 3 [Obs: 1697805 Fraud:4043]
    Out of Time Validation set: Week 4 [Obs: 4043 Fraud:2048]
    Classification Model: XGBoost
    
    Split Model Development Period into Traina nd Test 
    5 Fold Cross Validation on Train data to find optimum n_estimator where Test AUPR curve is maximum
    Optimum n_estimator=1296 (cross validation on 1300 estimators, scope to check by increasing n_estimator max limit)
    Since cross validation took sisgnificant amount of time and other hyperparameter tuning provides marginal gain, develop model keeping other hypermparameters constant
    learning_rate =0.05,
    n_estimators=1296,
    max_depth=5,
    min_child_weight=1,
    gamma=0,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    objective= 'binary:logistic',
    nthread=4,
    scale_pos_weight=419,
    seed=27
    
    Result:
    AUPRC Train= 0.9992531495369624
    AUPRC Test= 0.9832524009221997
    AUPRC OOT= 0.990502966074935
    Threshold Score: 0.99983096 [Minimum score where Precision is maximum, in this case max Precision is 1]
    Depending on the objective of the model, to minimize False Poistive (maximise Precision) or minimize False Negative (maximise TPR) we can choose the threshlod score
